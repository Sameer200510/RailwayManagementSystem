# RailwayManagementSystem
🚄 Railway Management System — Full-Stack Project Showcase
After weeks of hands-on development, debugging, and system-level customization, I’m excited to share my latest project: a fully functional Railway Management System built using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL, hosted locally via XAMPP.
🔧 Key Features:
- Train search functionality with live database queries
- Booking form with seat tracking and validation
- Admin-side reporting and data management
- Custom ER diagram, SQL schema, and full documentation
- Hosted locally and tested across devices via IP routing and ngrok tunneling
💡 Challenges Overcome:
- Resolved MySQL plugin conflicts (caching_sha2_password.dll)
- Reconfigured phpMyAdmin access and user authentication
- Enabled cross-device access without shared LAN using secure tunneling
- Built the backend logic from scratch and simulated DBMS behavior with static web tech
📁 Tech Stack: HTML · CSS · PHP · MySQL · XAMPP · phpMyAdmin · Windows Shell · ngrok
This project reflects my passion for full-stack development, system-level troubleshooting, and building real-world solutions under constraints. If you're working on similar setups or want to collaborate on backend-heavy builds — let’s connect!
